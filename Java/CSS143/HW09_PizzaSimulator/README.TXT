PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Individually designed program for users to order and customize pizza based on size and toppings

Code was implemented in Java and tested by creating several pizzas and outputting their descriptions using 
print statements and private instance variables to store size of pizza and number of meat and/or veggie toppings

The program computes total cost of pizza order using Scanner, if-statements, and methods to prompt the user for choice
of size and toppings, while printing each additional cost of size, meat, and/or veggie by adding the total
value of each customization
