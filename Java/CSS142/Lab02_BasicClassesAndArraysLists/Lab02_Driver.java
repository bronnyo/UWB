/**
 * 1) Why did we do so much copying and pasting in our software above?
 *      to become more aware of the issues that some with doing so
 *      such as syntax errors and wrongly named methods within their classes
 *      
 *(2)Are there obvious improvements that could be made here with respect the software 
 *   design for Squares and Circles?
 *      The could be put into the same class, as essentially their class definitions 
 *      are nearly identical.
 *      
 * 3)What programming constructs were you familiar with, and which did you need to look up?
 *      Considering the last 3 weeks of 142 last quarter was all about classes, i was pretty familiar
 *      with all of these constructs and didnt have to look up a single thing.
 *      
 * 4) Assume we used a separate array for Squares and for Circles rather than one unifying Object array.
 *    How would this complicate the task of adding a new Shape (say, a Triangle) to our ObjectListclass?
 *      you would then have to go back through your program and create yet 
 *      another array just for triangles.
